# Further Reading
Once you complete Week 1 fundamentals, you could look in more depth at the topics we covered.

Our recommendations are:

- [Data Modelling for Data Warehouses](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/agile-data-warehouse/9781771374095/)
- [Complete Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/python-programming-language/9780134217314/)
- [SQL full course](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/learning-sql/9780134193700/)
- [Apache Spark (paid)](https://www.udemy.com/course/azure-databricks-spark-core-for-data-engineers/)

In the four-week course, you won't have much time during Week 1, so the recommended course is [Data Modelling for Data Warehouses](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/agile-data-warehouse/9781771374095/). This has the widest applicability to Data Engineering. It's quite long, but you can skim the interesting topics.
